# Lymphovascular Invasion (LVI) Detection in Breast Cancer Using Deep Learning

This repository contains code and models for the detection of Lymphovascular Invasion (LVI) in breast cancer tissues using deep learning techniques. The approach is based on Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) and leverages histological data for the automated classification of cancerous tissues.

## Overview

Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) is a critical histological feature for predicting the prognosis of breast cancer. This project presents a deep learning-based approach for detecting LVI in whole-slide images (WSI) of breast cancer tissues. Our method applies Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) to incorporate spatial information and improve detection performance.

### Key Features:
- MIL framework for semi-supervised learning.
- Support for ImageNet and self-supervised features.
- Pre-trained models for LVI detection.
- Evaluation on a breast cancer dataset containing annotated whole-slide images.
